### Human Vs Machine Project
```
We have developed a CheXNet machine learning algorithm to diagnose Pneumonia by analyzing the X-rays. 
We will run that algorithm on some X-ray Images to collect the Machine generated results. 
In the same way, we manually diagnose the x-rays by Radiologist to generate Human/User generated result. 
By comparing both the results, the user will get a score against the machine.

•	Included login authentication and mail confirmation using SQLAlchemy.
•	Delivered a working prototype for machine learning phase.
